# BeatPose [wip]

Prototype to play BeatSaver with body movements using Posenet and Tensorflow.js

Based on the awesome work by Supermedium on the [beat saver viewer](https://github.com/supermedium/beatsaver-viewer).



## Development

Built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), a web framework that we created for
building VR experiences. And JavaScript.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Then head to `localhost:9999` in your browser.
